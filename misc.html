  <li> <b>Rolling hit points</b>
    <ul>
      Roll 3 hit dice and take the highest.
    </ul>
  </li>
  <p>

  <li> <b>Bennies</b>
    <ul>
      Each player starts the very first session with one bennie.
      This bennie may be expended during play, converted for experience or saved for
      future sessions.
    </ul>
    <p>

    <ul>
      Players earn bennies through roleplaying, mapping, running combat or
      keeping a log.  These roles are assigned at the start of the campaign but
      may be changed if desired at a later date assuming all parties agree.
    </ul>
    <p>

    <ul> <b>Cartographer</b> - A cartographer earns one bennie for each
      map he maintains during a session.  Usually this applies for dungeons and
      overland hexes.  Once a dungeon level is cleared, the mapper may earn an
      additional two bennies for redrawing the map and providing a key.
      Short notes about encounters and events may also be included on the map
      if desired, but not a complete log.  This map will then be scanned at
      the next session and uploaded to the webpage for all players to reference
      as desired.
    </ul>
    <p>

    <ul><b>Chronicler</b> - A chronicler takes notes of the campaign. They are
      responsible for recording the narrative of play in a diary format.  Who
      did what, when and where.  A chronicler earns one bennie for
      maintaining a log during play.  Converting the log to a narrative story
      for everyone to read, preferably in the format of a diary or short story
      will earn and additional two bennies.  This may be typed or hand written
      and will be scanned for upload to the webpage when complete.  Artistic
      drawings are optional, but would possibly earn more bennies depending
      on level of effort.
    </ul>
    <p>

    <ul> <b>Quartermaster</b> - The quartermaster records all experience earned,
      tracks all wealth found and who ends up with what.  They also record all
      equipment carried by each character and determines the resulting
      encumbrance.  The quartermaster earns one bennie for maintaining this log
      during play.  Converting the log to a libra office spread sheet in between
      sessions will earn the quartermaster an additional two bennies.
      This data will then be uploaded to the webpage for all players to view.
    </ul>
    <p>

    <ul> <b>Commander</b> - The Commander runs combat during play.  He
      tracks initiative and moves figures (including those run by the GM when
