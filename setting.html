Millenia ago, the world was plunged into a dark age.  The old gods abandonned mankind and the secrets of the arcane were lost to antiquity.  Centuries passed and the remaining cultures clung onto life.  Elves sought refuge in their thick forests, creating secluded strongholds amonge the trees. The dwarves secured thier halls within the bowels of their great mountains.  Mankind built stongholds of wood and stone to fend off the horros unleashed during this dark age.  From this struggle arose The Church of Everlasting Light, centered around the teachings of Saint Augustus the Light Bringer.
